# O2PLS

Welcome to the O2PLS package page on Github!

O2PLS is designed for integrating two high dimensional datasets and the O2PLS package is an implementation of this method.

Install the package with:

    devtools::install_github("selbouhaddani/O2PLS")
    library(O2PLS)

If that doesn't work, try the source .tar.gz or the Windows binaries .zip.

For questions, complaints, bugs, etc, you can mail me or file an issue.

When using the O2PLS R-package in your research, please cite the corresponding article by running command
